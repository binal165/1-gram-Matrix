2408678	the recentlydeveloped statistical method known as the bootstrap can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies it involves resampling points from ones own data with replacement to create a series of bootstrap samples of the same size as the original data each of these is analyzed and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data in the case of phylogenies it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently majorityrule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples if a group shows up 95 of the time or more the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling when all characters are perfectly compatible as envisioned by hennig bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters
23751	unique dna sequences can be determined directly from mouse genomic dna a denaturing gel separates by size mixtures of unlabeled dna fragments from complete restriction and partial chemical cleavages of the entire genome these lanes of dna are transferred and uvcrosslinked to nylon membranes hybridization with a short sup32supplabeled singlestranded probe produces the image of a dna sequence ladder extending from the 3supsup or 5supsup end of one restriction site in the genome numerous different sequences can be obtained from a single membrane by reprobing each band in these sequences represents 3 fg of dna complementary to the probe sequence data from mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from several cell types are presented the genomic sequencing procedures are applicable to the analysis of genetic polymorphisms dna methylation at deoxycytidines and nucleic acidprotein interactions at single nucleotide resolution
1912352	this paper discusses the bias that results from using nonrandomly selected samples to estimate behavioral relationships as an ordinary specification error or omitted variables bias a simple consistent two stage estimator is considered that enables analysts to utilize simple regression methods to estimate behavioral functions by least squares methods the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is derived
70083	a method has been devised for the electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets the method results in quantitative transfer of ribosomal proteins from gels containing urea for sodium dodecyl sulfate gels the original band pattern was obtained with no loss of resolution but the transfer was not quantitative the method allows detection of proteins by autoradiography and is simpler than conventional procedures the immobilized proteins were detectable by immunological procedures all additional binding capacity on the nitrocellulose was blocked with excess protein then a specific antibody was bound and finally a second antibody directed against the first antibody the second antibody was either radioactively labeled or conjugated to fluorescein or to peroxidase the specific protein was then detected by either autoradiography under uv light or by the peroxidase reaction product respectively in the latter case as little as 100 pg of protein was clearly detectable it is anticipated that the procedure will be applicable to analysis of a wide variety of proteins with specific reactions or ligands
67376	a new method for determining nucleotide sequences in dna is described it is similar to the plus and minus method sanger f  coulson a r 1975 j mol biol 94 441448 but makes use of the 2supsup3supsupdideoxy and arabinonucleoside analogues of the normal deoxynucleoside triphosphates which act as specific chainterminating inhibitors of dna polymerase the technique has been applied to the dna of bacteriophage  x174 and is more rapid and more accurate than either the plus or the minus method
1745369	the commonly observed high diversity of trees in tropical rain forests and corals on tropical reefs is a nonequilibrium state which if not disturbed further will progress toward a lowdiversity equilibrium community this may not happen if gradual changes in climate favor different species if equilibrium is reached a lesser degree of diversity may be sustained by niche diversification or by a compensatory mortality that favors inferior competitors however tropical forests and reefs are subject to severe disturbances often enough that equilibrium may never be attained

2459010	a high number of tree species low density of adults of each species and long distances between conspecific adults are characteristic of many lowland tropical forest habitats i propose that these three traits in large part are the result of the action of predators on seeds and seedlings a model is presented that allows detailed examination of the effect of different predators dispersal agents seedcrop sizes etc on these three traits in short any event that increases the efficiency of the predators at eating seeds and seedlings of a given tree species may lead to a reduction in population density of the adults of that species andor to increased distance between new adults and their parents either event will lead to more space in the habitat for other species of trees and therefore higher total number of tree species provided seed sources are available over evolutionary time as one moves from the wet lowland tropics to the dry tropics or temperate zones the seed and seedling predators in a habitat are hypothesized to be progressively less efficient at keeping one or a few tree species from monopolizing the habitat through competitive superiority this lowered efficiency of the predators is brought about by the increased severity and unpredictability of the physical environment which in turn leads to regular or erratic escape of large seed or seedling cohorts from the predators
1912934	this paper presents a parameter covariance matrix estimator which is consistent even when the disturbances of a linear regression model are heteroskedastic this estimator does not depend on a formal model of the structure of the heteroskedasticity by comparing the elements of the new estimator to those of the usual covariance estimator one obtains a direct test for heteroskedasticity since in the absence of heteroskedasticity the two estimators will be approximately equal but will generally diverge otherwise the test has an appealing least squares interpretation
1914185	this paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk and develops an alternative model called prospect theory choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory in particular people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty this tendency called the certainty effect contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses in addition people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration this tendency called the isolation effect leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms an alternative theory of choice is developed in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights the value function is normally concave for gains commonly convex for losses and is generally steeper for losses than for gains decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities except in the range of low probabilities overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling
68319	we describe a very sensitive method to detect as antigens the presence of specific proteins within phage plaques or bacterial colonies we coat plastic sheets with antibody molecules expose the sheet to lysed bacteria so that a released antigen can bind and then label the immobilized antigen with radioiodinated antibodies thus the antigen is sandwiched between the antibodies attached to the plastic sheet and those carrying the radioactive label autoradiography then shows the positions of antigencontaining colonies or phage plaques a few molecules of antigen released from each bacterial cell generate an adequate signal
61400	a convenient technique for the partial purification of large quantities of functional polyadenylic acidrich mrna is described the method depends upon annealing polyadenylic acidrich mrna to oligothymidylic acidcellulose columns and its elution with buffers of low ionic strength biologically active rabbit globin mrna has been purified by this procedure and assayed for its ability to direct the synthesis of rabbit globin in a cellfree extract of ascites tumor inasmuch as various mammalian mrnas appear to be rich in polyadenylic acid and can likely be translated in the ascites cellfree extract this approach should prove generally useful as an initial step in the isolation of specific mrnas

66230	dna can be sequenced by a chemical procedure that breaks a terminally labeled dna molecule partially at each repetition of a base the lengths of the labeled fragments then identify the positions of that base we describe reactions that cleave dna preferentially at guanines at adenines at cytosines and thymines equally and at cytosines alone when the products of these four reactions are resolved by size by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel the dna sequence can be read from the pattern of radioactive bands the technique will permit sequencing of at least 100 bases from the point of labeling
2461605	comparative studies of the relationship between two phenotypes or between a phenotype and an environment are frequently carried out by invalid statistical methods most regression correlation and contingency table methods including nonparametric methods assume that the points are drawn independently from a common distribution when species are taken from a branching phylogeny they are manifestly nonindependent use of a statistical method that assumes independence will cause overstatement of the significance in hypothesis tests some illustrative examples of these phenomena have been given and limitations of previous proposals of ways to correct for the nonindependence have been discussed a method of correcting for the phylogeny has been proposed it requires that we know both the tree topology and the branch lengths and that we be willing to allow the characters to be modeled by brownian motion on a linear scale given these conditions the phylogeny specifies a set of contrasts among species contrasts that are statistically independent and can be used in regression or correlation studies the considerable barriers to making practical use of this technique have been discussed

2825234	this review organizes ideas on the evolution of life histories the key lifehistory traits are brood size size of young the age distribution of reproductive effort the interaction of reproductive effort with adutl mortality and the variation in these traits among an individuals progeny the general theoretical problem is to predict which combinations of traits will evolve in organisms living in specified circumstances first consider single traits theorists have made the following predictions 1 where adult exceeds juvenile mortality the organism should reproduce only once in its lifetime where juvenile exceeds adult mortality the organism should reproduce several times 2 brood size should maximize the number of young surviving to maturity summed over the lifetime of the parent but when optimum broodsize varies unpredictably in time smaller broods should be favored because they decrease the chances of total failure on a given attempt 3 in expanding populations selection should minimize age at maturity in stable populations when reproductive success depends on size age or social status or when adult exceeds juvenile mortality then maturation should be delayed as it should be in declining populations 4 young should increase in size at birth with increased predation risk and decrease in size with increased resource availability theorists have also predicted that only particular combinations of traits should occur in specified circumstances 5 in growing populations age at maturity should be minimized reproductive effort concentrated early in life and brood size increased 6 one view holds that in stable environments late maturity multiple broods a few large young parental care and small reproductive efforts should be favored kselection in fluctuating environments early maturity many small young reduced parental care and large reproductive efforts should be favored rselection 7 but another view holds that when juvenile mortality fluctuates more than adult mortality the traits associated with stable and fluctuating environments should be reversed we need experiments that test the assumptions and predictions reviewed here more comprehensive theory that makes more readily falsifiable predictions and examination of different definitions of fitness

2459379	it is suggested that local animal species diversity is related to the number of predators in the system and their efficiency in preventing single species from monopolizing some important limiting requisite in the marine rocky intertidal this requisite usually is space where predators capable of preventing monopolies are missing or are experimentally removed the systems become less diverse on a local scale no relationship between latitude 10supsup to 49supsup n and diversity was found on a geographic scale an increased stability of annual production may lead to an increased capacity for systems to support higherlevel carnivores hence tropical or other ecosystems are more diverse and are characterized by disproportionately more carnivores
